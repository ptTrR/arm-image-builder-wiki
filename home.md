# Why using the Builder 

The builder improves your image, we are applying patches for a better performance, stability, ... .
Also, the builder is actively maintained, you don't need to be afraid that it is just a "short-project".

## Basics

- If you're most things are done automatically, 
- Easy Crossbuilding on your powerful host system, so that the time is reduced much at building
- Many improvements are done automatically by the builder, just take a watch at our patches, which are included
- Upgrading Kernel, firmware, and some other scripts, which are included, are easily done with a few commands

# Using Docker

We have created a Docker image which already installed all dependencies for native and cross-compiling and also native compiling. So that only a few dependencies are needed, also it is isolated from your system.

## Using the docker-helper

The usage of the "docker-helper" will help you easily to exec into the container and the magic is mostly done within some commands.
